Your goal is to trace the steps taken by the attacker on the compromised machine and determine how they managed to bypass the Network Intrusion Detection System \"NIDS\". A memory dump of this system has been taken for analysis. Your task is to analyze this dump, trace the malwares actions, and report key findings",
