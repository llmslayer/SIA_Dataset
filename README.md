# SIA_Dataset

Welcome to the **SIA_Dataset** repository! üöÄ This dataset is designed for **Security Incident Analysis (SIA)** tasks, encompassing various cybersecurity investigation domains such as **Network Forensics, Disk & Memory Forensics, Malware Analysis, and more.**

üìå The dataset consists of **21 unique security scenarios** with **193 investigative questions** in total. [üìÑ Detailed Dataset Information](Tasks_Dataset/Dataset.md)

We evaluate different LLMs with our dataset using [ü§ñ SIA Agent](Agent/agent.md).
